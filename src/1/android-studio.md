# Configuring Android Studio
Setting up Android Studio is usually a one-time process. Android Studio is the interface used between the code and robot.

You will need a GitHub account with access to the Murray-Bridge-Bunyips organisation (or to use the `MBHSRobotics` shared account).

For MBHS Student Robotics Club members, you can follow [this guide in the shared drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iZ2eS7Tr0e4pBBBeyeKwgJa_2NdkLZIelezqBSOWug/edit?usp=sharing) to get your account set up. Note you will need a mentor to add you to the organisation
and add your user to the `BunyipsFTC` GitHub team if not using the shared account.

## First-time setup
if you are a mbhs student you will have to do a couple more steps if you are not dont worry about these step. 

Setting up the certificates settings for mbhs students. Make your way into  `settings`.

You are now on the development branch of BunyipsFTC. You can now Commit and Push your changes from Android Studio to upload them to the cloud.

## Configuring BunyipsLib
Before you proceed with programming, you will also need to change to the latest commit (master branch) of BunyipsLib.

Open the branch menu shown before, and this time click on `BunyipsLib`. Open `Remote`, `origin`, `master`, and click `Checkout`.

Your computer is now configured to use BunyipsFTC. These steps do not need to be repeated for this computer.

Once Gradle completes syncing (you can manually initialise a sync with Ctrl+Shift+O), the Android view on the left should display robot files.
